Java Games is an implementation of Tetris and the Number Slide game. Project is built with core java and a small graphics package relying on java.awt. This project demonstrates my ability to utilize graphics packages, object-oriented design, concurrency and threading, as well as the A* algorithm used when solving number slide. 

You can check out the repository [here](https://github.com/adammhockman/java-games).


### Neighborhood Clusters

Neighborhood clusters is a data science project built with python and Jupyter notebooks. This project uses unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster neighborhoods using Foursquare data as the primary feature vector.
