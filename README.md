Java Games is an implementation of Tetris and the Number Slide game. Project is built with core java and a small graphics package relying on java.awt. This project demonstrates my ability to utilize graphics packages, object-oriented design, concurrency and threading, as well as the A* algorithm used when solving number slide.
